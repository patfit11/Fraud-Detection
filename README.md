# Fraud-Detection
A simple Logistic Regression approach to get started.

Not intended to be the final model, this is just a jumping off point for the IEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition on Kaggle.

This is a simple log regression model utilizing only 4 main factors which yielded a ~63% detection rate.  Ultimately, the goal is to implement a stronger model utilizing more of the available feature variables to increase detection accuracy.

However, for now, this was a great exercse in coding graphs using the ggplot2 package in R.
